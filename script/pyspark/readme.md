# Pyspark

# Intro:
This is a quick readme for the pyspark workflow runner.

# Details:
The AoU runners can include dsub, cram/wdl, or pyspark.  This workflow introduces the pyspark runner as an example within the hla typing for AoU workbench.  Much of the documentation needed for spark/pyspark running on AoU is non-existent, so this sub-repo is intended to fill the gap and introduce usable methods.

# Installation/background:
I initially installed this on a local wsl2 ubuntu instance in a windows 10 computer.  Code is written/tested in a VS code UI with standard jupyter notebook and pip/conda depends.

Please install appropriate pip libraries before executing scripts.
